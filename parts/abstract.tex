Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have emerged as one of the best methods to classify nodes using either external information or the graph structure itself through label propagation. However, current GCN approaches are based on a single snapshot of a graph or multi-graphs. We propose to combine GCN with recurrent neural networks and show that such a formalism outperforms the precision obtained in single graph-based predictions. We tested this method on a dataset of firms product similarity and shown it can be used to predict the future success of companies or forthcoming collapse. A similar comparison on a blog network and a prediction of the activity of bloggers produces similar results.
