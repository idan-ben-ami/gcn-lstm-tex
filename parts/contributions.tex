\section{Main contributions of current research}
The main advances presented here compared with existing methods are:
\begin{itemize}
\item   Using topological information or the sum of first and second neighbors in each class of the training set as input to GCN in absence of external information.
\item   Combination of directed label propagation, topology and external information in one coherent framework.
\item   Combination of this framework into a recurrent network formalism to handle evolving graphs, and showing it outperforms static approaches. 
\end{itemize}
